See, right now, I need you, I'll meet you somewhere now
You up now, I see you, I get you, take care now
Slow down, be cool, I miss you, come here now
It's yours now, keep it, I'll hold out until now
I need you right now, once I leave you I'm strung out
If I get you, I'm slowly breaking down
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here

He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then lets me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then lets me go

Soon as you leave me, we always lose connection
It's gettin' messy, I fiend for your affection
Don't loosen your grip got a hold on me
Now, forever, let's get back together

Lord, take it so far away
I pray that, God, we don't break
I want you to take me up and down
And round and round again

And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking we could never be a pair
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here
And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here

He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then lets me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then lets me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then lets me go
He love me not, he loves me
He holds me tight, then lets me go

You're gonna say that you're sorry at the end of the night
Wake up in the morning, everything's alright
At the end of the story, you're holdin' me tight
I don't need to worry, am I out of my mind?

And, oh, it's hard to see you, but I wish you were right here (I'm losing my mind)
Oh, it's hard to leave you when I get you everywhere
All this time I'm thinking, I'm strong enough to sink it
Oh, no, I don't need you, but I miss you, come here
